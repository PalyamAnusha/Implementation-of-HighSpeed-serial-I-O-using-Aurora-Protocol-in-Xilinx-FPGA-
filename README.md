Implementation of High Speed serial I/O using Aurora Protocol in Xilinx FPGA 

Input/output (I/O) has always played a crucial role in computer and industrial applications. But as signal processing became more sophisticated, problems arose that prevented reliable I/O communication. In early parallel I/O buses, interface alignment problems prevented effective communication with outside devices. And as higher speeds became prevalent in digital design, managing signal delays became problematic.
Thus, this project aims at the implementation of High-Speed Serial I/O which gives effective communication with minimum delay and reduces the design complexity.

Implementation of High Speed serial I/O using Aurora Protocol in Xilinx FPGA

# Introduction

The I/O (Input Output) module works as a mediator between I/O devices and the processor. It conveys the information from I/O device to processor and vice versa. I/O devices are usually electronic devices where processor is an electronic device. I/O devices are majorly of two types: Parallel I/O and Serial I/O.
Parallel I/O devices were used initially, as the number of input data bits increased the design complexity also increased proportionally which in turn resulted in the increase of the cost of equipment.
Therefore serial I/O devices became prominent, in the early 1980s when the IBM PC was first introduced IBM and other companies quickly made RS232 serial communications addon boards available to allow the connection of the PC to external devices. But the only disadvantage of the serial I/O was they were not capable of transmitting data quickly because of the sequential transmission rather than simultaneous.
Thus project aims to develop a protocol for the implantation of High Speed Serial I/O devices which has the data rate up to Gbps and which can achieve nano seconds operations.

# Formulation of Objectives:
This project divided into two phases and the objectives are formulated as stated below:

Phase I 
•	Identification of hardware resources inside FPGA
•	Installation of Tool and Aurora 8B/10B core module Generation
•	Simulation of protocol
 
 Phase II
•	Porting
•	Testing on hardware

# Key Components:

Xilinx FPGA (e.g., Kintex-7, Artix-7, Zynq-7000, or Virtex-7)
Aurora 8B/10B IP Core from Xilinx IP Catalog
GTX/GTH Transceivers
Xilinx Vivado Design Suite
Simulation Tools: Vivado Simulator, ModelSim, or VCS

# Implementation Steps:

# 1. Aurora IP Core Configuration
Open Vivado → IP Catalog → Add Aurora 8B/10B IP

Set parameters: Lane width, number of lanes, simplex/duplex mode, clock frequency, etc.

# 2. Design Top Module
Instantiate Aurora core.

Connect to user logic (FIFO or BRAM).

Connect to transceiver reference clocks and reset logic.

# 3. Clocking
Use MMCM/PLL to generate proper clocks.

Clock compensation may be required for reliable operation.

# 4. Simulation
Write a testbench to verify TX → RX loopback.

Monitor status signals (channel up, lane up, hard error, soft error).

# 5. Synthesis and Implementation
Synthesize the design using Vivado.

Generate bitstream and load it onto FPGA.

# 6. Testing on Hardware
Use loopback or connect two boards via SMA/FPGA connectors.

Analyze throughput, latency, and error metrics.

# Advantages of Using Aurora:

1.Low overhead compared to full-blown protocols (like Ethernet or PCIe)
2.Scalable (single/multiple lanes)
3.Lightweight, easy to integrate
4.Ideal for board-to-board or chip-to-chip links

# Applications:

Board-to-board communication
Chip-to-chip interconnects
Sensor data streaming
High-speed memory access
Real-time video/audio transmission

# Future Scope:

Upgrade to Aurora 64B/66B for higher throughput and efficiency
Integration with custom AXI4 stream logic
Implementation on RFSoC or Versal platforms
Use optical links for longer-distance communication
